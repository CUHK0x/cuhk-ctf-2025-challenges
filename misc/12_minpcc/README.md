## Description
You know what, this is crazy. If you take CSCI2100A, they make you write data structures in C from scratch! And you have to type the entire code for the data structure in the programming exam! Good thing my typing speed is not bad...

Anyways, the new programming assignment is released. I heard from a friend that there is some kind of vulnerability in the PC\* system setup that they are using, so I wrote this new online judge, and I call it "MinPCC", "The minimalist's alternative to PC\*". The system that they coded with so many lines of Java code, I just coded with three shell scripts. Why use some kind of framework only to code a small web application? Less code, less mistakes, less vulnerability. What can possibly go wrong?

Also, while you are at it, can you do my assignment for me? Seems easy enough. It is totally because I am lazy, and definitely not because I cannot code.
