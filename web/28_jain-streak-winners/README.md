# Jain Streak Winners

## Summary
- Author: chemistrying
- Difficulty: 3
- Protocol: null

## Description
My web programming skills are too good that I can code webservers in obscure frameworks... That means no one can hack my server, and I'll be the winner!

Note: this challenge shares the same server with "Jain Streak Dreamers", but they are not correlated (meaning you can solve both challenges independently). Also, the flag format for this challenge is `cuhk25ctf{\w+}`.
