## Description

This CUSIS isn’t as secure as it looks… 😏 (not the real one lol)

Can you log in as the special user and uncover the hidden secrets?  
The first half of the flag hides in the dashboard, the second half is in the search page.   
**Hint**: sometimes a single quote `'` is all it takes to get what you’re looking for.

Suggestion: Classic SQL injection skills required — nothing too fancy, just clever exploitation.    
If you do not know what is SQL injection, `YouTube` and `Google` will be your teacher :)
