Players need to bypass the login page by classic SQL technique, such as 
    -single quotation '
    -comment "--"
    -or 1=1
    etc.
Then they can get the first half flag: cuhk25ctf{SQL_1s_
Then there is instruction asking players to modify the url "/search?q=<something>"

They can use the same SQL injection techniques to do so.
When the url is modified correctly, the second half will be shown: N0t_Th4t_HaRd_1o1}

Note that a fake flag is given when they try to use something like "admin' --" for the username.
