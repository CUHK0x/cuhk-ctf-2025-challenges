# CUHK CTF 2025

## Description
Below is the challenges in CUHK CTF 2025 held on 26-28 September. Writeups are redacted until the writeup workshop.

## Folder Structure Explanation
Challenge folders are placed under their corresponding categories (`crypto`, `forens`, `misc`, `pwn`, `rev`, `web`, `cloud`). Under each challenge folder, `public` folder represents the materials given to the participants. `deploy` folder contains secrets used during deployment in the challenge server. `README.md` contains challenge description and necessary challenge info. There is also a `[id]_flag.txt` for the flag used in the challenge.

## Running Challenge Server
Some challenges have a challenge remote server. You can spin up one by doing the following procedures. However, please note that you shouldn't expose the challenges to the public or your machine might be compromised. It is highly recommended to do it in a virtual machine.
