# Iam Mr. Cow or Mr. Cloud

## Challenge Info
- Author: Mr.Cow

- Protocol: null

## Description
Out on the edge of the pasture, a ladder climbs into the sky.
At the top sits a quiet vault of silver—guarded by two peculiar doormen:

* **Mr. Cow**, who lets you peek inside but never touch.
* **Mr. Cloud**, who lets you take exactly one thing—if he believes who you are.

A tiny storefront page is all you’re given. It looks harmless, but it reflects the sky and whispers just enough about the rules above. In this realm, **names matter more than keys**. Those who shape their identity with care will earn a glance… and, with the right guise, the right to claim the treasure.

The vault responds to IAM principals whose ARN names end in MrCow or MrCloud; tailor your profile suffix and each guardian reveals their part.
