## Description
Inside the shifting halls of the Infinity Castle, a ServiceAccount named **nakime** holds the key to distant vaults beyond the cluster. The mirrors that once confirmed every step have splintered, so you’ll need to trust your footing, catch the murmured signal she sends skyward, and claim the secret she protects before the castle rearranges itself again.
